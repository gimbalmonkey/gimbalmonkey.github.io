# Summary

A motivated graduate student studying forest management and remote sensing techniques at Oregon State University. My interests include using Geographical Informational Systems (GIS) and spatial science to tackle forest management issues using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). My roles in academia and the federal government have given me the opportunity to continue working on my passion of researching resource management in forest landscapes.
